## The fwdpp home page

This is the homepage for __fwdpp__, which is a C++ template library for implementing forward-time population-genetic simulations.

### Source code

The library code is [here](https://github.com/molpopgen/fwdpp)

### Library documentation

* [Reference manual](doc/html/index.html) generated from the library source code.  The manual also contains a tutorial on writing policies for simulations.

### Google group

There is a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fwdpp-users) for fwdpp users.

### Citation

If you use __fwdpp__ for yor research, either to develop simulations or you use the example programs, please cite the following manuscript:

* Thornton, K. R. (2014) A C++ template library for efficient forward-time population genetic simulation of large populations.  Genetics 98:157-166  PMID: 24950894, [Manuscript](http://www.genetics.org/content/198/1/157.abstract), [Software](https://github.com/molpopgen/fwdpp)


### Applications of fwdpp 

The library has been used for the following software projects:

* [fwdpy](https://github.com/molpopgen/fwdpy) uses __fwdpp__ to provide an environment for foward simulation in Python.  This is a very large-scale project, and is where a lot of our future forward-simulation-related tools will end up.

### Publications (that we are aware of...) using fwdpp

Thornton. 2017. “A Model of Compound Heterozygous, Loss-of-Function Alleles Is Broadly Consistent with Observations from Complex-Disease GWAS Datasets.” PLoS Genetics 13 (1): e1006573. [Paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006573)  This paper also uses [fwdpy](http://github.com/molpopgen/fwdpy) for some of the supplementary material.

### Early applications of fwdpp

Early version of the code that eventually became __fwdpp__ were used in the following publications:

* [Thornton et al.](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1003258) on modeling "rare alleles of large effect" and genome-wide association studies
* [Baldwin-Brown et al.](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/4/1040.full) on modeling "evolve and resequence" experiments"
